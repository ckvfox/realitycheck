  <!-- 1️⃣ Project Intention -->
  <section id="intention" style="margin-bottom:3rem;">
    <h2>What This Project Is About</h2>
    <p>
      The world is changing – politically, socially, and ecologically.  
      We often hear that “everything used to be better” and that “the world is going downhill.”  
      <b>RealityCheck</b> aims to challenge that narrative — with facts instead of feelings.  
      The central question is: <em>How is our world really doing?</em>
    </p>

	<p>
	  Nothing is god-given. Nothing is destiny.  
	  Humanity created the systems that shape our world – and humanity can change them again.  
	  Where there is will, there is a way. This project is about clarity, awareness, and hope.
	</p>

	<p>
	  As historian <em><a href="https://www.ynharari.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yuval Noah Harari</a></em> reminds us in his 
	  acclaimed series <em>“Sapiens,” “Homo Deus,”</em> and <em>“21 Lessons for the 21st Century,”</em>  
	  the world we live in is built on human imagination — our institutions, economies, and beliefs are stories we agreed to tell together.  
	  Because humanity created them, humanity can also change them.  
	  This insight connects <b>RealityCheck</b> with thinkers like Harari, 
	  <em><a href="https://www.earth4all.life" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Earth for All</a></em>, 
	  and <em><a href="https://www.gapminder.org/factfulness-book/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hans Rosling’s Factfulness</a></em>:  
	  a shared belief that understanding the world through facts is the first step toward improving it.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Inspired by the book <em><a href="https://www.earth4all.life" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Earth for All”</a></em> by the Club of Rome, 
	  RealityCheck embraces the idea that infinite growth on a finite planet is impossible.  
	  The question is not <em>whether</em> we need to rethink, but <em>how fast</em> we can.
	</p>

    <p>
      The main challenges ahead are clear:
      <ul>
        <li>Limiting climate change and protecting biodiversity</li>
        <li>Reducing inequality, poverty, and misinformation</li>
        <li>Strengthening democracy, education, and global cooperation</li>
      </ul>
      <b>RealityCheck</b> provides the data foundation for that transformation –  
      understandable, comparable, and interactive.

  <!-- 2️⃣ Programming with ChatGPT -->
  <section id="collaboration" style="margin-bottom:3rem;">
    <h2>Programming with ChatGPT</h2>
    <p>
      This project is the result of an unusual collaboration between human and AI –  
      between myself (Carsten), acting as business analyst, requirements manager, and tester –  
      and ChatGPT, serving as developer and creative partner.
    </p>

    <p>
      The technical challenge wasn’t just about merging APIs, JSON structures, and data formats –  
      it was about aligning logic, intention, and context.  
      “Prompt programming” requires precision, patience, and structure –  
      just like any real project, but expressed through language instead of code.
    </p>
	
	<p>
	  I know what it takes to program well, and I know what the result of good programming is... 
	  Chat-GPT has worked wonders in between ;-) 
    </p>
	
    <p>
      <b>What worked well:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Iterative development – continuous refinement of layout, data logic, and UX</li>
        <li>Strict naming conventions and clear folder structure</li>
        <li>Automated data handling and transparency in all steps</li>
      </ul>
      <b>What was challenging:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Maintaining context over long iterations</li>
        <li>Keeping frontend and backend logic consistent (mappings, fetch behavior, CORS issues)</li>
        <li>Working around hosting limitations (e.g. InfinityFree – no server-side processing)</li>
      </ul>
      <b>Recommendations for others:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Use clear, modular structures (naming, file hierarchy, JSON schemas)</li>
        <li>Think in iterations: “make it work, then make it right, then make it beautiful”</li>
        <li>Always create backups and dummy data before connecting live sources</li>
        <li>Treat ChatGPT as a <em>team member</em> – not a code vending machine</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

  <!-- 3️⃣ About Me -->
  <section id="about-me">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I live near Cologne, Germany. I’m married and a father of three.  
      Professionally, I’m the head of an IT division in an insurance company –  
      a “techie” at heart who loves structure, data, and problem solving.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>RealityCheck</b> is a passion project – born from curiosity and a belief  
      that data can tell a more hopeful story than headlines.  
      The world is not doomed; it’s changing. And we still decide how.
    </p>

    <p style="font-style:italic;">
      Built through curiosity, patience, and collaboration –  
      with facts, reason, and optimism. <br><br>
