    <p>
      Protecting your privacy is very important to us.
      This website does not use cookies and does not collect any personal data.
    </p>

    <p>
      We do not use analytics tools, advertising networks or third-party tracking.
      The only information stored locally in your browser is your personal KPI weighting, 
      using <code>localStorage</code>. This is never transmitted to our servers.
    </p>

    <p>
      The backend stores anonymous server logs (via <code>tracking.php</code>), including:
      <br>â€“ Anonymized IP address
      <br>â€“ Date and time of access
      <br>â€“ Requested page or file
      <br>â€“ Browser type and version
    </p>

    <p>
      These logs are not linked to individuals and are used solely for performance monitoring and abuse prevention.
    </p>

    <p class="note">
      Some content (such as rankings or summaries) may be generated using artificial intelligence (OpenAI GPT models).
      However, no personal data is used or shared in this process.
    </p>

    <p>
      You have the right to request access to any data stored about you and request its deletion at any time.

      RealityCheck stands for transparency, privacy, and user empowerment â€” no cookies, no ads, no hidden tracking.
