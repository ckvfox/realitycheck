    <p>
      Protecting your personal data is very important to us. 
      This website does not collect or store any personal data and does not use cookies.

    <p>
      Only minimal, anonymous technical information is logged, such as:

      <br>â€“ Date and time of access
      <br>â€“ Accessed page / URL
      <br>â€“ Browser type and version
    </p>
    <p>
      These logs cannot be linked to an identifiable person.
      The minimal tracking pixel (<code>tracking.php</code>) only produces anonymous JSON-based server logs.
