  "title": "Global Supply Chain Stress Index",
  "description": "The Global Supply Chain Stress Index measures disruptions and pressure within international supply chains based on shipping costs, delivery times, and trade volumes. Higher index values indicate more stress in the flow of goods and raw materials, often caused by geopolitical tensions, pandemics, or logistical bottlenecks. Lower values represent stable supply networks with efficient transportation and balanced global demand. This indicator helps evaluate the resilience of the global economy and the vulnerability of trade-dependent countries.",
