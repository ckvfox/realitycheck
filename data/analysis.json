  "analysis_text": "- Overview\nThe global picture mixes steady human development with uneven progress and rising environmental and governance stress. Basic services like water, vaccines, and literacy improved over time, yet large gaps remain between high-income democracies and lower-income, fragile, or resource‑dependent states. Air pollution, climate risk, conflict pockets, and inequality continue to weigh on health, trust, and growth. The economy is more digital and urban, but the green transition is not fast enough to offset emissions and pollution.\n\n- Highlights (positive developments)\n• Human development: Average HDI is in the medium range (0.683). Life expectancy and literacy are far higher than a generation ago; overall immunization is high (80%).  \n• Basic services: Access to basic drinking water averages 85%, showing broad improvement.  \n• Digitalization: Internet use, while uneven, keeps rising; fixed broadband and mobile access continue to expand.  \n• Education and health systems: Countries spend about 4.3% of GDP on education on average; hospital beds (4.2 per 1,000) and physicians (1.7 per 1,000) point to gradual capacity gains.  \n• Energy transition: Renewables average 33% of energy mix (often hydro and bioenergy). EV stocks are scaling fast, led in absolute terms by China and in per‑capita terms by several European countries and Nordics.  \n• Poverty reduction: Average extreme poverty is 11%, with notable declines in parts of East and South Asia.\n\n- Lowlights (negative developments)\n• Environmental stress: Average PM2.5 exposure (27.5 μg/m³) is far above WHO guidelines, with many outliers in South and East Asia and parts of the Middle East. The Environmental Performance Index average (43/100) remains modest.  \n• Health gaps: Infant and maternal mortality averages (49 per 1,000 and 231 per 100,000) are still high relative to SDG targets, with large variance.  \n• Inequality and exclusion: The average Gini (37) signals sizable inequality; female labor force participation is only 50% on average, with very low rates in some regions.  \n• Macroeconomic fragility: Inflation is volatile (mean 13% with extreme outliers), and public debt has risen in many economies.  \n• Road safety: Road deaths average 17.9 per 100,000, a persistent burden in lower‑ and middle‑income countries.  \n• Peace and conflict: The Global Peace Index average (2.03; lower is better) and conflict outliers show that violence remains concentrated but severe where it occurs.\n\n- Political & Regional Differences\n• Democracies vs autocracies:  \n  - Democracies (many OECD/EU/G7 members) tend to score higher on press freedom, lower perceived corruption, better EPI, higher happiness, and better health outcomes. They also have higher internet penetration and recycling rates.  \n  - Autocracies and hybrid regimes often deliver large-scale infrastructure quickly and can achieve high immunization or literacy, but they typically score worse on press freedom, air quality, and perceived corruption.  \n  - Exceptions: China leads EV adoption and large-scale renewables despite lower democracy scores; some small democracies (Nordics, New Zealand) have world‑class EPI, trust, and happiness.\n\n• Economic power groups:  \n  - OECD/EU/G7: High HDI and life expectancy; aging and low fertility; strong internet and EV uptake; better recycling; but higher public debt and consumption footprints.  \n  - G20: Dominates global GDP and emissions; decisive for climate outcomes. Internal diversity is large (e.g., EU vs India/Indonesia).  \n  - BRICS: Strong absolute emissions (China, India), rising digitalization, mixed governance, and often higher PM2.5. Brazil stands out on renewables (hydro, wind), and South Africa faces high inequality.  \n  - Resource exporters (Gulf, Russia, parts of Africa and LatAm): High GDP per capita or fiscal space in some cases but lower press freedom and female labor participation; emissions per capita and air pollution can be high; growth and inflation can be more volatile with commodity cycles.\n\n• Regional patterns:  \n  - Europe: High EPI and happiness, strong recycling and internet; rapid EV and renewables; challenges are aging, energy security, and fiscal pressures.  \n  - East Asia: High literacy and life expectancy (Japan, Korea); very high EV scale (China); air pollution still a major health risk in some hubs.  \n  - South Asia: Big gains in poverty reduction and immunization; severe PM2.5; fast urbanization and digital catch‑up.  \n  - Sub‑Saharan Africa: Young populations and high age dependency; lower water access, literacy, and internet; higher maternal/infant mortality; poverty and conflict pockets; renewable shares often high but reflect traditional biomass and energy access gaps.  \n  - Middle East & North Africa: Urban and energy‑rich in parts; low female labor participation in several countries; air pollution and water stress; conflict hot spots affect resilience.  \n  - Latin America: High urbanization; mid‑to‑high inequality; growing renewables in select cases (Uruguay, Costa Rica); macro volatility in some economies.\n\n- Interrelations & Global Dynamics\n• Development bundle: Higher GDP per capita correlates with better HDI, life expectancy, hospital capacity, internet access, and lower infant/maternal mortality. Democracies typically reinforce these through stronger institutions, press freedom, and lower corruption.  \n• Green transition trade‑offs: Wealthy democracies recycle more and have better EPI, yet high consumption keeps CO2 high. Emerging economies add renewables but struggle with PM2.5 due to coal, biomass, and vehicles.  \n• Urbanization and digitalization: Urban, richer states show faster internet uptake and service access but also higher PM2.5 and congestion; road deaths tend to be higher in rapidly motorizing economies.  \n• Demography and fiscal stress: Aging (high old‑age dependency in OECD/EU/NE Asia) raises health and pension costs; young, high‑fertility regions need massive job creation and education investment.  \n• Governance and resilience: Better press freedom and lower corruption link to higher happiness, peace, and EPI. Fragile states score worse on resilience and conflict indicators, amplifying migration pressures.  \n• Resource dependence: Commodity booms raise growth and revenues but also CO2, inflation volatility, and governance risks; low tax bases in some oil states reduce incentives for accountability.\n\n- Forecast & Outlook\n• Health and education: Continued gains in life expectancy and schooling in most regions, but progress will be slower where conflict and fiscal stress persist. Closing the maternal and infant mortality gap requires primary care and financial protection.  \n• Climate and environment: EVs and renewables will grow fast in G7/EU/China; coal phase‑down and clean cooking in South Asia and Africa are essential to cut PM2.5. Expect more climate shocks (heat, floods), pressuring food prices and migration.  \n• Economy and prices: Global inflation should ease unevenly; commodity‑exposed and weak‑institution countries remain vulnerable. Public debt will constrain budgets, especially in aging economies.  \n• Inequality and labor: Without stronger tax systems and social protection, inequality will stay elevated. Female labor participation is a major untapped growth lever in MENA and South Asia.  \n• Peace and migration: Conflict clusters likely to persist, driving regional displacement. Safer mobility corridors and integration policies will be increasingly important.  \n• Geopolitics: A more multipolar system (G7/EU vs BRICS+ dynamics) will shape technology, energy, and trade flows. Cooperation in the G20 is pivotal for climate finance and debt relief.\n\n- Short Global Conclusion\nThe world is healthier, more educated, and more connected than before, but progress is uneven and fragile. Democracies, especially in the OECD/EU, lead on wellbeing, environment, and trust but face aging and fiscal burdens. Large emerging economies drive clean‑tech scale yet struggle with pollution and governance. Fragile and low‑income states carry the heaviest loads—poverty, conflict, and climate risk. To bend the curve, the priorities are clear: cut air pollution and emissions, lift basic services and women’s work, improve governance and resilience, and finance a fair energy transition through coordinated action across the G20 and key regional blocs. Positive exceptions (Nordics on EPI and happiness; China on EV scale; Costa Rica/Uruguay on renewables; Rwanda/Viet Nam on service delivery and poverty reduction) show what is possible; negative outliers (hyperinflation and conflict cases; high‑pollution hotspots; extreme inequality) highlight where urgent support and reforms are needed.",
